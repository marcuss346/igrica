# igrica

So this game is my school project that we had to do to finish our programming class. It's objective is to collect 
as many animals as you want. but don't get killed by enemies because you will loose points.

Game is made in c++ and is using SDL for graphics. If you want to compile it i reccomend using CLion beacuse u have cmakelists.txt, which
makes everything much more easier.

Hope you enjoy!
